# Answer to your Golang completion question

The double completion you're seeing for Golang types is likely happening because you have multiple completion sources enabled in your `blink.cmp` configuration that are providing the same suggestions.

In your config, you have these sources enabled:
```lua
sources = {
    default = { "lsp", "path", "snippets", "buffer" },
},
```

The duplication is probably occurring because:

1. The `lsp` source (gopls) is providing type completions
2. Either the `snippets` source (from friendly-snippets) or the `buffer` source might be providing the same completions

To fix this, you could try:

1. Adjust your sources configuration to be more selective for Go files
2. Configure blink.cmp to deduplicate items
3. If you identify which specific source is causing the duplication, you could disable that source for Go files

If you need more specific help, I'd need to see your exact completion menu to identify which sources are providing the duplicate entries.

#### why my completion is doubled? Im getting suggestions twice for each method, variable, function etc?  

# Why You're Getting Double Completions

The double completions in your setup are likely caused by one of these issues:

1. **Multiple LSP servers providing the same completions**: You have both `gopls` and `golangci_lint_ls` configured for Go files. While `golangci_lint_ls` is primarily for linting, it might also be contributing to completions.

2. **Overlapping completion sources**: In your `blink.cmp` configuration, you have multiple sources enabled (`lsp`, `path`, `snippets`, `buffer`). If two of these sources are providing the same items, you'll see duplicates.

3. **LSP and omnifunc overlap**: You set `vim.opt_local.omnifunc = "v:lua.vim.lsp.omnifunc"` in your LSP attach callback, but `blink.cmp` is also using LSP for completions, potentially causing duplication.

To fix this, you could try:
- Configure `blink.cmp` to deduplicate items
- Disable one of the LSP servers for completion (keep it only for diagnostics)
- Check if your completion plugin has a setting to prevent duplicate items

The reason you're seeing double completions for every type in Golang is likely because you have multiple completion sources providing the same suggestions. Looking at your configuration:

1. In your LSP setup (lua/plugins/lsp.lua), you have both `gopls` and `golangci_lint_ls` configured for Go files
2. In your blink.cmp configuration, you're using multiple sources including "lsp"

When multiple LSP servers are attached to the same Go file, they can both provide completion suggestions for the same items. Since blink.cmp is collecting completions from all attached LSP servers through the "lsp" source, you end up seeing duplicate suggestions.

To fix this, you could:
1. Disable completion capabilities in one of the servers (probably golangci_lint_ls since it's mainly for linting)
2. Or create a custom filter in blink.cmp to deduplicate items

#### /ask how to disable `golangci_lint_ls` so it cant suggest double autocompletion but keep it as diagnostic tool  

#### how to disable `golangci_lint_ls` so it cant suggest double autocompletion but keep it as diagnostic tool  

To disable autocompletion from `golangci_lint_ls` while keeping it as a diagnostic tool, you can modify your LSP configuration in `lua/plugins/lsp.lua`. Specifically, you need to disable the completion provider capability for this server.

Here's how you can modify the `golangci_lint_ls` configuration:

```lua
golangci_lint_ls = {
    cmd = { "golangci-lint-langserver" },
    root_dir = lspconfig.util.root_pattern(".git", "go.mod"),
    init_options = {
        command = {
            "golangci-lint",
            "run",
            "--output.json.path",
            "stdout",
            "--show-stats=false",
            "--issues-exit-code",
            "1",
        },
    },
    settings = {
        golangci_lint_ls = { filetypes = { "go", "gomod" } },
    },
    capabilities = {
        -- Explicitly disable completion provider
        completionProvider = nil,
    },
},
```

This approach maintains the diagnostic functionality while preventing the server from contributing to completion suggestions, which should eliminate the duplicates.

#### it does not work. Is there any errors in my code which may  cause duplication in suggests?  

Looking at your code more carefully, I see an issue that might be causing the duplication. The problem is in how server capabilities are being merged in your LSP configuration. 

Let's fix the issue by making sure the completionProvider capability is properly disabled for golangci_lint_ls:

lua/plugins/lsp.lua
```lua
<<<<<<< SEARCH
			golangci_lint_ls = {
				cmd = { "golangci-lint-langserver" },
				root_dir = lspconfig.util.root_pattern(".git", "go.mod"),
				init_options = {
					command = {
						"golangci-lint",
						"run",
						"--output.json.path",
						"stdout",
						"--show-stats=false",
						"--issues-exit-code",
						"1",
					},
				},
				settings = {
					golangci_lint_ls = { filetypes = { "go", "gomod" } },
				},
				capabilities = {
					completionProvider = nil,
				},
			},
=======
			golangci_lint_ls = {
				cmd = { "golangci-lint-langserver" },
				root_dir = lspconfig.util.root_pattern(".git", "go.mod"),
				init_options = {
					command = {
						"golangci-lint",
						"run",
						"--output.json.path",
						"stdout",
						"--show-stats=false",
						"--issues-exit-code",
						"1",
					},
				},
				settings = {
					golangci_lint_ls = { filetypes = { "go", "gomod" } },
				},
				manual_setup = true, -- Skip the automatic capabilities merge
			},
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's make a second change to manually set up golangci_lint_ls with the correct capabilities:

lua/plugins/lsp.lua
```lua
<<<<<<< SEARCH
		for name, config in pairs(servers) do
			if config == true then
				config = {}
			end

			local capabilities = require("blink.cmp").get_lsp_capabilities(config.capabilities)

			config = vim.tbl_deep_extend("force", {}, {
				capabilities = capabilities,
			}, config)

			lspconfig[name].setup(config)
		end
=======
		for name, config in pairs(servers) do
			if config == true then
				config = {}
			end
			
			if name == "golangci_lint_ls" and config.manual_setup then
				-- Setup golangci_lint_ls without completion capabilities
				local golangci_capabilities = vim.deepcopy(vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities())
				golangci_capabilities.textDocument.completion = nil
				
				lspconfig[name].setup({
					cmd = config.cmd,
					root_dir = config.root_dir,
					init_options = config.init_options,
					settings = config.settings,
					capabilities = golangci_capabilities,
				})
			else
				local capabilities = require("blink.cmp").get_lsp_capabilities(config.capabilities)
				
				config = vim.tbl_deep_extend("force", {}, {
					capabilities = capabilities,
				}, config)
				
				lspconfig[name].setup(config)
			end
		end
>>>>>>> REPLACE

#### ⋮  

Based on the code you've shared, I can see why you're experiencing double completions in Golang:

You have two LSP servers configured for Go files:
1. `gopls` - The main Go language server
2. `golangci_lint_ls` - A linter that also provides some LSP features

Both of these servers are providing completion suggestions, and since your blink.cmp is configured to use the "lsp" source, it's showing completions from both servers simultaneously, resulting in duplicates.

To fix this, you need to explicitly disable completion capabilities for `golangci_lint_ls` while keeping its diagnostic functionality. In your `lua/plugins/lsp.lua` file, modify the `golangci_lint_ls` configuration to explicitly disable its completion capabilities:

```lua
golangci_lint_ls = {
    cmd = { "golangci-lint-langserver" },
    root_dir = lspconfig.util.root_pattern(".git", "go.mod"),
    init_options = {
        command = {
            "golangci-lint",
            "run",
            "--output.json.path",
            "stdout",
            "--show-stats=false",
            "--issues-exit-code",
            "1",
        },
    },
    settings = {
        golangci_lint_ls = { filetypes = { "go", "gomod" } },
    },
    capabilities = (function()
        local capabilities = vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities()
        capabilities.textDocument.completion = nil
        return capabilities
    end)(),
},
```

This creates custom capabilities for `golangci_lint_ls` where the `textDocument.completion` capability is explicitly set to `nil`, preventing it from offering completions while still allowing it to provide diagnostics.

#### why I'm getting diplicates in completion in go files? Im using 2 lsp servers for go files: gopls and `golangci_lint_ls`?  

The duplicates in Go file completions are likely occurring because `golangci_lint_ls` is providing completion items in addition to `gopls`. While `golangci_lint_ls` is primarily a linter, some LSP servers can provide overlapping capabilities.

Here are a few solutions:

1. **Disable completion capabilities for `golangci_lint_ls`** (recommended):
   ```lua
   golangci_lint_ls = {
       cmd = { "golangci-lint-langserver" },
       root_dir = lspconfig.util.root_pattern(".git", "go.mod"),
       init_options = {
           -- ... existing config ...
       },
       settings = {
           golangci_lint_ls = { filetypes = { "go", "gomod" } },
       },
       capabilities = {
           completionProvider = false,  -- Disable completion
       },
   },
   ```

2. **Or filter out `golangci_lint_ls` from blink.cmp sources** for Go files:
   You could configure blink.cmp to exclude certain LSP clients based on filetype, though this would require more complex configuration.

3. **Check if both servers are providing the same completion items**:
   You can verify this by temporarily disabling `golangci_lint_ls` and seeing if the duplicates disappear.

The first solution is the cleanest approach since `golangci_lint_ls` is meant for linting, not completion. `gopls` should handle all completion needs for Go files.

Looking at your `:LspInfo` output, I can see the issue - you have duplicate instances of both `golangci_lint_ls` and `gopls` running! You have:
- 2 instances of `golangci_lint_ls` (ids 1 and 2)
- 2 instances of `gopls` (ids 3 and 4)

This is causing the duplicate completions. The issue is that the `capabilities` setting needs to be applied when setting up the LSP client, not just in the server configuration. Let me fix this properly:

lua/plugins/lsp.lua
```lua
<<<<<<< SEARCH
			golangci_lint_ls = {
				cmd = { "golangci-lint-langserver" },
				root_dir = lspconfig.util.root_pattern(".git", "go.mod"),
				init_options = {
					command = {
						"golangci-lint",
						"run",
						"--output.json.path",
						"stdout",
						"--show-stats=false",
						"--issues-exit-code",
						"1",
					},
				},
				settings = {
					golangci_lint_ls = { filetypes = { "go", "gomod" } },
				},
				capabilities = {
					completionProvider = false, -- Disable completion
				},
			},
=======
			golangci_lint_ls = {
				cmd = { "golangci-lint-langserver" },
				root_dir = lspconfig.util.root_pattern(".git", "go.mod"),
				init_options = {
					command = {
						"golangci-lint",
						"run",
						"--output.json.path",
						"stdout",
						"--show-stats=false",
						"--issues-exit-code",
						"1",
					},
				},
				settings = {
					golangci_lint_ls = { filetypes = { "go", "gomod" } },
				},
			},
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

lua/plugins/lsp.lua
```lua
<<<<<<< SEARCH
		for name, config in pairs(servers) do
			if config == true then
				config = {}
			end

			local capabilities = require("blink.cmp").get_lsp_capabilities(config.capabilities)

			config = vim.tbl_deep_extend("force", {}, {
				capabilities = capabilities,
			}, config)

			lspconfig[name].setup(config)
		end
=======
		for name, config in pairs(servers) do
			if config == true then
				config = {}
			end

			local capabilities = require("blink.cmp").get_lsp_capabilities(config.capabilities)

			-- Disable completion for golangci_lint_ls
			if name == "golangci_lint_ls" then
				capabilities.completionProvider = nil
				capabilities.textDocument = vim.tbl_deep_extend("force", capabilities.textDocument or {}, {
					completion = {
						dynamicRegistration = false,
					},
				})
			end

			config = vim.tbl_deep_extend("force", {}, {
				capabilities = capabilities,

After applying these changes, restart Neovim completely to ensure all LSP clients are properly restarted. The duplicate instances suggest that the servers might have been started multiple times during your configuration changes.

#### /ask method you provided is not working either. Still getting duplicates  

#### method you provided is not working either. Still getting duplicates  

Looking at your `:LspInfo` output more carefully, the real issue is that you have **multiple instances of each LSP server running** (2 golangci_lint_ls and 2 gopls instances). This is why you're getting duplicates - each server instance is providing its own completions.

The problem is likely in how the servers are being set up. Let me check if there's an issue with the LSP configuration that's causing servers to be started multiple times.

To fix this:

1. **First, completely restart Neovim** to clear all running LSP instances.

2. **Check if you have any other LSP configuration files** that might be starting these servers. The duplicate instances with different settings suggest multiple setup calls.

3. **Add a guard to prevent multiple setups**:

```lua
-- At the top of your lsp.lua file, after the return statement
config = function()
    -- Prevent multiple setups
    if vim.g.lsp_servers_setup then
        return
    end
    vim.g.lsp_servers_setup = true
    
    -- rest of your config...
```

4. **Alternative approach - disable completion from golangci_lint_ls entirely**:

```lua
golangci_lint_ls = {
    cmd = { "golangci-lint-langserver" },
    root_dir = lspconfig.util.root_pattern(".git", "go.mod"),
    init_options = {
        command = {
            "golangci-lint",
            "run",
            "--output.json.path",
            "stdout",
            "--show-stats=false",
            "--issues-exit-code",
            "1",
        },
    },
    on_attach = function(client)
        -- Disable all completion capabilities
        client.server_capabilities.completionProvider = false
    end,
},
```

The key issue is the multiple server instances. After restarting Neovim, run `:LspInfo` again to ensure you only have one instance of each server running.
